## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Box Model
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TypeScript - Programming Language
- CSS Modules - For styles

### What I learned

How to get the user's screen width to show an appropriate view. If the size changes, the view maybe change too. I wrote a React Custom Hook the deal with this requirement:

```ts
const useViewport = () => {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.screen.width);

  useEffect(() => {
    const resizeObserver = new ResizeObserver(() => {
      setWidth(window.screen.width);
    });

    resizeObserver.observe(document.body);
  }, []);

  return width;
};
```

Thinking in reusability, some UI components were built to used in the entire application:

```ts
const Button = (props: Props) => {
  let btnClasses = classes.btn;

  btnClasses += props.fullSize ? ` ${classes.full} ` : ' ';
  if (props?.variant === 'outlined') {
    btnClasses += classes['btn-outlined'];
  }
  if (props?.variant === 'contained') {
    btnClasses += classes['btn-contained'];
  }

  return <button className={btnClasses}>{props.children}</button>;
};
```

```ts
const Backdrop = (props: Props) => {
  return <div onClick={props.onClick} className={classes.backdrop}></div>;
};
```

### Continued development

While developing this project, I realized that I have to improve one basic skill, CSS. I'm taking Schwarzm√ºller's CSS course and trying to solve Frontend Mentor Challenges to fill that gap. Furthermore, applying React concepts as important as well.
